### Practice Questions:
-- 1. Convert all patient names to uppercase.
SELECT 
	UPPER(name) as Name
FROM patients

-- 2. Find the length of each staff member's name.
SELECT 
	*,
    LENGTH(staff_name) as Length_of_staff_name
FROM staff

-- 3. Concatenate staff_id and staff_name with a hyphen separator.
SELECT 
	*,
    CONCAT(staff_id, "-", staff_name) as Concatenated_staff_id_staff_name
FROM staff

### Daily Challenge:
-- Question:
-- Create a patient summary that shows patient_id, full name in uppercase, service in lowercase, age 
-- category (if age >= 65 then 'Senior', if age >= 18 then 'Adult', else 'Minor'), and name length. Only 
-- show patients whose name length is greater than 10 characters.
SELECT 
	patient_id,
    UPPER(name) AS full_name,
    LOWER(service) AS service_name,
    CASE
		WHEN age >= 65 THEN 'Senior'
        WHEN age >= 18 THEN 'Adult'
        ELSE 'Minor'
	END AS age_category,
    LENGTH(name) AS length_of_patient_name
FROM patients
WHERE LENGTH(name) > 10
